| Docker (18.03.1-CE)         | Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. To get started with Docker, review the information on their [website](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/). Review instructions for [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce) or [Docker EE](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ee/ubuntu/) to install Docker on Ubuntu. |
| Docker Compose (1.21.1 or later) | Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To install Docker Compose, complete the [prerequisites](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#prerequisites) and then perform [installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose). 


Installing the EclecticIQ ER Server
-------------------------------

After you install Docker and Docker Compose, you can install the EclecticIQ ER
server.


1. Checkout this repository on the local server.

2.  Switch to the repository directory.

    ```~/Downloads\$ cd plgx-esp/```
3.  Enter the certificate-generate.sh script to generate certificates for
    osquery.  
    ```~/Downloads/plgx-esp$ sh ./certificate-generate.sh <IP address>```
    ```x.x.x.x
    Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
    .........................................................................................+++
    .........................+++
    writing new private key to 'nginx/private.key'
    ``` 
            
    In the syntax, \<IP address\> is the IP address of the system on which on to host the EclecticIQ ER server. This will generate 
    the certificate for osquery (used for provisioning clients) and place the certificate in the plgx-esp folder.

4.  Modify and save the .env file.

    1.  Edit the following configuration parameters in the file. In the syntax, replace the values in angle brackets with required values.
    ```
    ENROLL_SECRET=<secret value>
    POLYLOGYX_USER=<user login name>

| RSYSLOG_FORWARDING       | Set to true to enable forwarding of osquery and EclecticIQ ER logs to the syslog receiver by using rsyslog. |
| VT_API_KEY       | Represents the VirusTotal API key.                                                                            |

| THREAT_INTEL_LOOKUP_FREQUENCY       | Specifies the frequency (in minutes) for fetching threat intelligence data.                                                                            |   
    2. Ensure all the ports specified in the YAML file are open and accessible
    3. Save the file.
    


   
5.  Run the following command to start Docker compose.

    ```docker-compose -p 'plgx-esp' up -d```
    
    Typically, this takes approximately 10-15 minutes. The following lines appear on
    the screen when Docker starts:
    ````Starting plgx-esp_rabbit1_1  ... done
        Starting plgx-esp_postgres_1 ... done
        Starting plgx-esp_plgx-esp_1     ... done
        Attaching to plgx-esp_rabbit1_1, plgx-esp_postgres_1, plgx-esp_plgx-esp_1
        .
        .
        .
        Server is up and running```
        
6.  Log on to server using following URL using the latest version of Chrome or
    Firefox browser.
    
    ```https://<ip address>:5000```

    In the syntax, `<IP address>` is the IP address of the system on which the
    EclecticIQ ER server is hosted. This is the IP address you specified in step 4.

7.  Ignore the SSL warning, if any.

8.  Log on to the server using the credentials provided above at step 5.

9.  Provision the clients. For more information, see [Provisioning the EclecticIQ ER
    Client for Endpoints](../03_Provisioning_EclecticIQ_ER_Client/Readme.md).

Uninstalling the Server 
------------------------

To uninstall the EclecticIQ ER server, run the following command to clean-up
existing Docker images and containers.

```~/Downloads\$ sh ./docker-cleanup.sh```

**Note:** This will clean **all** the images and containers.

Upgrading the Server
--------------------

EclecticIQ ER can be upgraded from the earlier supported release through an upgrade script.

The upgrade_script.sh script is part of the platform bundle.

EclecticIQ ER could also be upgraded manually. Complete these steps to perform an upgrade:

1. Upgrade the code to the latest version with git pull or downloading the released bundle

2. Back up the certificate.crt and private.key files stored in the nginx directory in the installation directory. 

3. Execute ```sudo bash upgrade_script.sh --path <Path to the old installation directory>```  

4. Update the ```.env``` file 

5. Execute ```docker-compose -p 'plgx-esp' up --build -d```
